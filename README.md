-- This is a term project for EECS 6893 Big Data Analytics course.

Online-shopping has become extremely common in our daily
life and recommendation system is an indispensable part of
that. Thus the performance of recommendation is very
significant.
However, the recommendation accuracy suffers from the lack
of different rule for different item categories, like books,
videogames, cellphones. So we want to try different
recommendation schema on the different categories's rating
data and compare the evaluation results with each other to
have a better understanding of the link between item
category and recommendation performance.
Eventually, we hope this finding would lead to enhance of
recommendation research on electronic merchandise.
